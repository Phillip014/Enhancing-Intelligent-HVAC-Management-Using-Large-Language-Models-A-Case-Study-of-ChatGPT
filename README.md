# Enhancing-Intelligent-HVAC-Management-Using-Large-Language-Models-A-Case-Study-of-ChatGPT

In technological advancement, integrating intelligent HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) managers with large language models and prompt engineering techniques revolutionizes HVAC systems. This integration enhances the system's ability to analyze user behavior and conversation data, addressing issues prevalent in traditional systems such as misunderstandings of user intent and imprecise HVAC action recommendations. This study's contributions are threefold: it improves the semantic understanding of the intelligent HVAC manager, increases the accuracy of HVAC action recommendations, and develops a human-computer dialogue system based on large models. Experimental results demonstrate ChatGPT's effectiveness, particularly in accuracy, although it faces challenges in complex situations and specific domain knowledge. Nonetheless, its advanced natural language capabilities offer new possibilities in the intelligent HVAC field, aiming to provide residents with convenient, energy-efficient, comfortable, and safe living environments.
